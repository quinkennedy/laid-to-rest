laid-to-rest
============

This is a piece originally created at [Art Hack Day: Afterglow](http://www.arthackday.net/events/afterglow). The piece memorializes dead links on the internet. As links on the internet are discovered that no longer function, they are documented on receipt paper and expunged from "the cloud." This installation highlights the broken pieces of the internet that are usually buried in archaic forum posts and disregarded websites. How many of these links started out life from the click of a "permalink" icon?
